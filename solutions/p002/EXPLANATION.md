# Problem:
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

# Naive Solution:
Recursively generating fib numbers and adding them to the sum if they are even is wasteful since 2/3 of the sequence are odd and have no use to us.

O(n)
```c
int fib(int a, int b) {
  int f = a+b;

  // If even, add to sum
  if (!(f & 1))
    sum += f;

  // Recursively find fib numbers until UPPER_BOUND is met 
  if (f+a < UPPER_BOUND)
    return fib(f, a);
  else
    return f;
}
```

# Optimized Solution
Since all numbers are formed off of past values, I figured there had to be a way to generate the even numbers based only on the previous even numbers.  After playing around with the numbers for a bit, I came up with this equation: 

$4 * p + i$

Where p is the integer 1 step ago, and i is the integer 2 steps ago.  This allows me to generate the even fib numbers without needing to know any of the odd ones:

O(n)
```c
  // Init to two since it's not a multiple of 4 ( lower )
  int sum = 2;

  int i = 0;
  int p = 2;

  // Iterate over even numbers in sequence
  while (sum < UPPER_BOUND) {
    sum += 4 * p + i;

    // Cache i for later use in p
    int cache = i;
    i = p;
    p = 4 * p + cache;
  }

  // Print answer
  printf("%d\n", sum);
```
> I had to start the sum at 2 since it is lower than 4.  Therefore this method cannot get numbers below 4.  ( Which isn't a problem in this case )
